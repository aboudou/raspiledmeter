********************
Requirements

How to use RasPiLEDMeter
********************

You'll first have to build the LED usage meter, and plug it  to the Raspberry Pi
  (check https://goddess-gate.com/dc2/index.php/pages/raspiledmeter.en for more 
  information).

Then update "config.py" file to use one of the provided scripts (or write your
  own). If you want to write your own script, you may want to check "dummy.sh"
  file to have explanations on the expected output format.

When you're done, just launch RasPiLEDmeter with "./raspiledmeter.sh start" as
  root user and admire the usage meter working :-) When you want / need to stop
  it, just execute "./raspiledmeter.sh stop" as root user.
