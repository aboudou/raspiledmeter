# This is a dummy script intended to illustrate the required format.
# 
# Any script to use with RasPiLEDMeter will need to ouput two lines :
# - the first one is the value to display
# - the second one is the maximum possible value
#
# In the below example, we want to display a value of 50 on 100, which will lead
# to light-up (50/100)*8 = 4 LEDs

echo "50"
echo "100"
